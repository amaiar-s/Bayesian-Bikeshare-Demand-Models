# Bayesian-Bikeshare-Demand-Models
This project uses Bayesian regression models, including Poisson and Negative Binomial, to predict bike rental demand for Seoulâ€™s Ddareungi system. By incorporating meteorological and temporal data, we forecast hourly demand while addressing outliers and irregular trends, aiming to improve bikeshare management.
