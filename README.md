# Bayesian-Bikeshare-Demand-Models
This project explores the use of Bayesian regression models, including Poisson and Negative Binomial models, for predicting bike rental demand in Seoulâ€™s Ddareungi Bikeshare system. The dataset, consisting of hourly bike rental counts from December 2017 to November 2018, is analyzed with meteorological factors (such as temperature, humidity, and precipitation) and temporal features (time of day, season) to predict bike demand on an hourly basis. The study addresses issues like outliers, irregular data patterns, and the impact of seasonality on demand. While the models show promise, challenges such as refining time-of-day categorization and improving accuracy through a broader dataset are identified. Future improvements include exploring multiple years of data and expanding the models to account for urban-specific variations in demand. This research aims to improve forecasting for urban bikeshare systems, enhancing their operational efficiency and planning.
